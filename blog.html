                <h2>Setting up a Proxmox Cluster with ZFS: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE) is an open-source platform for virtualization that combines
                    two powerful technologies: KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for virtualization and LXC (Linux
                    Containers) for lightweight containerization. Setting up a Proxmox cluster allows you to manage and
                    migrate virtual machines across multiple physical hosts seamlessly. ZFS, a scalable and efficient
                    file system, can be used as the storage backend for Proxmox, providing features such as data
                    integrity, compression, and snapshots.</p>

                <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Three physical machines with Proxmox VE installed.</li>
                    <li>A network connection between the three machines.</li>
                    <li>Basic knowledge of Linux command-line interface.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 1: Install Proxmox VE</h3>

                <p>Install Proxmox VE on each of the three machines by following the official installation guide
                    provided by Proxmox. You can download the ISO image from the Proxmox website and boot your machines
                    from it to begin the installation process</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Configure Network Settings:</h3>

                <p>Ensure that each machine has a unique hostname and IP address assigned. You can configure the network
                    settings either during the installation process or after installation using the `nmtui` or `ip`
                    command-line tools.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Prepare Storage with ZFS:</h3>

                <p>1. On each Proxmox node, prepare the storage using ZFS. Run the following commands to install the
                    required packages and create a ZFS pool:</p>
                <pre><code id="code-snippet-1">
                    apt-get update
                    apt-get install zfsutils-linux -y
                    </code></pre>
                <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-snippet-1')">Copy</button>
                <p>2. Once the packages are installed, create a new ZFS pool using the disks or partitions you want to
                    allocate for storage:</p>
                <pre><code id="code-snippet-2">
                    zpool create &lt;pool_name&gt; &lt;disk1&gt; &lt;disk2&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-snippet-2')">Copy</button>
                <p>Replace `<pool_name>` with the desired name for your ZFS pool and &lt;disk1&gt;, &lt;disk2&gt;, etc.,
                        with the names of the disks or partitions you want to include in the pool.</p>
                <p>3. Verify that the ZFS pool has been created successfully by running:</p>
                <pre><code id="code-snippet-3">
                    zpool list
                    </code></pre>
                <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-snippet-3')">Copy</button>
                <p>Repeat this process on each Proxmox node to create a consistent storage setup across the cluster.</p>
                <h3>Step 4: Configure Proxmox Cluster:</h3>
                <p>1. Log in to the Proxmox web interface on one of the nodes by accessing its IP address in a web
                    browser.</p>
                <p>2. Navigate to the "Datacenter" view and click on "Cluster" in the left sidebar.</p>
                <p>3. Click on the "Join Information" tab and note down the cluster configuration details, including the
                    "Node Name," "Node IP," and "Authentication Key."</p>
                <p>4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the remaining nodes in the cluster.</p>
                <p>5. On each node, click on the "Join Information" tab and enter the information obtained from step 3
                    to join the cluster.</p>
                <p>6. Once all nodes have been added to the cluster, you should see them listed under the "Cluster" tab
                    in the Proxmox web interface.</p>
                <h3>Step 5: Configure Shared Storage:</h3>
                <p>1. In the Proxmox web interface, navigate to the "Datacenter" view and click on "Storage" in the left
                    sidebar.</p>
                <p>2. Click on "Add" and select "ZFS" as the storage type.</p>
                <p>3. Enter a name for the storage, select the ZFS pool you created in Step 3, and click "Add."</p>
                <p>4. Repeat this process on each node to add the same ZFS storage pool as shared storage across the
                    cluster.</p>
                <h3>Step 6: Test High Availability (Optional):</h3>
                <p>To test the high availability of the Proxmox cluster, you can migrate a virtual machine from one node
                    to another using the Proxmox web interface. This ensures that virtual machines remain accessible
                    even if one of the nodes fails.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>You have successfully set up a Proxmox cluster on three machines using ZFS as the storage backend.
                    This cluster configuration provides high availability and scalability for your virtualized
                    infrastructure, allowing you to efficiently manage and migrate virtual machines across multiple
                    nodes.</p>

<h2>Setting up Lancache Docker on Synology Without Port Mapping</h2>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>In this guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up Lancache Docker on your Synology NAS without relying on port mapping. Lancache is a caching proxy server designed to significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve download speeds for various game launchers and platforms.</p>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p>Before we begin, ensure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Synology NAS with Docker installed</li>
    <li>Basic familiarity with Docker and Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM)</li>
   </ul>

<h3>Step 1: Install Docker on Synology:</h3>
<p>If you haven't already, install Docker from the Synology Package Center. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare Docker Container:</h3>
  <p>1. Open Docker on your Synology NAS.</p> 
   <p>2. Go to the "Registry" tab and search for "lancachenet/lancache:latest" in the search bar.</p>
   <p>3. Download the Lancache Docker image by clicking on it and selecting "Download."</p>
   <p>4. Once downloaded, go to the "Image" tab, select the Lancache image, and click "Launch."</p>
   <p>5. In the "Advanced Settings," configure the container settings as needed, including resource allocation and network settings. Ensure to disable port mapping for this setup.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Configure Container Environment Variables:</h3>
   <p>1. After launching the container, go to the "Container" tab and select the Lancache container.</p>
   <p>2. Click on "Details" and then "Edit" to modify the container settings.</p>
   <p>3. Under the "Environment" section, add the necessary environment variables for Lancache configuration. These variables include CACHE_IP, DNS_IP, and INTERFACES. Refer to the Lancache documentation for detailed instructions on configuring these variables.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Start Lancache Container:</h3>
   <p>1. Once you've configured the environment variables, click "Apply" to save the changes.</p>
   <p>2. Start the Lancache container by clicking on "Action" and selecting "Start."</p>

<h3>Step 5: Verify Lancache Setup:</h3>
   <p>1. After the container has started successfully, verify that Lancache is running correctly by accessing its web interface or checking the container logs for any errors.</p>

<h>Conclusion:</h>
<p>By following these steps, you can set up Lancache Docker on your Synology NAS without relying on port mapping. This configuration allows Lancache to effectively cache game downloads and updates, reducing bandwidth usage and improving download speeds for your gaming devices on the network.</p>
